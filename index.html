He was also a writer, a philanthropist, a Hungarian nationalist and a Franciscan tertiary.<br><br>Liszt gained renown in Europe during the early nineteenth century for his prodigious virtuosic skill as a pianist. He was a friend, musical promoter and benefactor to many composers of his time, including Frédéric Chopin, Richard Wagner, Hector Berlioz, Robert Schumann, Camille Saint-Saëns, Edvard Grieg, Ole Bull, Joachim Raff, Mikhail Glinka, and Alexander Borodin.<br><br>A prolific composer, Liszt was one of the most prominent representatives of the New German School (Neudeutsche Schule).
